This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository]

My research 
======
**(1) Unraveling the mysteries of the non-canonical translatome**<br/>
[Systematic identification, characterization, and functional analysis of non-canonical open reading frames (ORFs), including uORFs, dORFs, lncORFs, circORFs and others.]()

**(2) Exploring the landscape of neoantigens and their applications**<br/>
[Developing efficient approaches to identify and characterize immunogenic neoantigens, and unlocking the source of cryptic neoantigens through translation of non-canonical ORFs.]()
